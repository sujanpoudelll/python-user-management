## Python User Management System

A beginner-level Python project focused on file handling, data validation, and a menu-driven interface. Users are stored in a JSON file (users.json) with unique IDs, and you can add, view, search, update, and delete users.

### Features
- Add users with unique ID, name, unique email, and age
- View all users with formatted display
- Search users by name or email
- Update user details (name, email, age)
- Delete users
- Input validation (e.g., age must be an integer ≥18)
- Persistent storage using users.json

### Purpose
This project was created during my Python learning journey to practice real-world programming concepts, including:
- File handling with JSON
- Input validation (e.g., age ≥ 18)
- Menu-driven CLI
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Writing reusable helper functions

***Updates in this version
- Improved Command-Line Interface (CLI) for better readability
- Users are now automatically sorted by name when displayed
- Added email duplication check when adding or updating a user
